## Assignment Brief

**Objective:**  
Build a mini mobile app in Flutter that displays a list of articles fetched from a public API. The app allows users to browse, search, and view article details.

**Core Features:**
- **Home Screen:**
    - Fetch and display articles from: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
    - Display articles in a ListView with cards showing the title and a short preview.
    - Show a loading indicator while fetching data.
    - Handle API errors gracefully.
- **Search:**
    - Add a search bar to filter articles by title or body (client-side search is acceptable).
- **Article Details Screen:**
    - When the user taps an article, navigate to a detail screen.
    - Display the full content (title and body).

**Technical Expectations:**
- Use Flutter 3+
- Apply state management (e.g., BLoC is used in this implementation)
- Maintain modular, clean code
- Use async/await with proper error handling

**Bonus Features (Optional):**
- Implement pull-to-refresh on the article list.
- Add favorite functionality and a dedicated favorites tab.
- Use local persistence (e.g., Hive) to save favorites.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd flutter_article_app

- Install Dependencies:
  flutter pub get
- Run the App:
  flutter run
  Tech Stack- Flutter SDK: Flutter 3+
- State Management: BLoC (using flutter_bloc)
- HTTP Client: http (for API calls)
- Persistence: Hive (for storing favorites)
  State Management ExplanationThis application uses the BLoC pattern to separate business logic from the presentation layer. Separate BLoCs are created for managing the article list, theme changes, and handling favorite selections. This approach ensures a clear and predictable data flow as state updates trigger reactive UI rebuilds.Known Issues / Limitations- API responses from jsonplaceholder may occasionally be slow or return errors, which might affect user experience.
- UI performance might need further tuning for very large datasets.
- Future improvements could include enhanced error handling for a variety of network disruptions and additional responsiveness for different screen sizes.
